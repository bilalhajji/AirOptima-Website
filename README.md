Project: Learning By Doing

During a six-month period, I actively participated in the "Learning By Doing" project at the École Centrale Casablanca fair.
Our team successfully presented our work on air pollution in urban areas. We developed an air purification solution based on electrostatic precipitation and provided guidelines for designing new constructions.
It was an invaluable opportunity to collaborate with talented colleagues and receive support from our mentor and domain experts.

The project aimed to address the pressing issue of air pollution and its impact on urban environments. 
Our solution leveraged electrostatic precipitation technology to remove harmful pollutants from the air, promoting cleaner and healthier living spaces.
Additionally, we developed comprehensive guidelines for architects and engineers to integrate air purification systems into their building designs, fostering sustainable and environmentally-friendly construction practices.

I actively contributed to the research, development, and testing phases throughout the project. 
I played a key role in implementing the electrostatic precipitation system, conducting performance evaluations, and documenting the project's progress.
Working alongside my teammates, I also actively engaged in brainstorming sessions and collaborative problem-solving to overcome technical challenges.

Our efforts resulted in a successful showcase at the École Centrale Casablanca fair, where we received positive feedback from attendees and industry professionals. 
To provide further information and showcase our work, we created a dedicated website: Air-optima.com. The website offers detailed insights into our project, including the technology employed, its effectiveness in combating air pollution, and the architectural guidelines for implementing air purification systems.

As part of my commitment to open-source collaboration, I have uploaded the project's code and relevant documentation to my GitHub repository. 
The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for fellow developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in exploring our air purification solution and its implementation guidelines. 
It also demonstrates my proficiency in programming languages, such as Python, utilized during the development of the project.

By sharing our work on GitHub, I aim to contribute to the collective knowledge and inspire others to address environmental challenges through innovative and sustainable solutions

In this project, you will find:

Code for working with the MQ-2 sensor: This code is designed to interface with the MQ-2 gas sensor using a Raspberry Pi 4. It enables the collection of data related to air quality, including the detection of various gases.

Code for transmitting data to ThingSpeak server: The project includes code that allows the Raspberry Pi 4 to send the collected air quality data to a ThingSpeak server. ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that provides cloud storage and visualization capabilities for sensor data.

System components: The project involves the integration of various system components, including the Raspberry Pi 4, MQ-2 sensor, and other necessary hardware. These components work together to measure and monitor air quality, enabling the collection and transmission of data for further analysis and visualization.

By combining the MQ-2 sensor, Raspberry Pi 4, and ThingSpeak server, the project provides a comprehensive system for monitoring and analyzing air quality in real-time. The collected data can be accessed remotely and used to gain insights into pollution levels, detect gas leaks, and assess the overall air quality in a given environment.
